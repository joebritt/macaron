macaron, an Arduino shield by Joe Britt

Inspired by Saandialâ€™s Petit Biscuit 
(https://www.tindie.com/products/saandial/petit-biscuit-arduino-programming/). 
I designed this variant as a shield so it could be used with any Uno compatible Arduino. 

It can also be used with an Arduino Mega, which will provide additional I/O pins so more things can be added. 
The board uses very bright high-efficiency LEDs from Avago/Broadcom and a linear potentiometer from Bourns. 

All parts are available from Mouser.  Mouser part numbers below: 

630-ALMD-EG2E-XZ002 Red LED 
630-ALMD-EL2E-XZ002 Amber LED 
630-ALMD-CM2F-12002 Green LED 
630-ALMD-CB2E-UV002 Blue LED 
652-PTL30-10G1-103B2 10K linear (slide) potentiometer with LED 
299-1.8K-RC 1.8Kohm through hole resistors (all resistors same value) 
(if you want brighter LEDs, use 1Kohm resistors) 

Headers are normal 0.1" single row.
2 tactile buttons are generic.
